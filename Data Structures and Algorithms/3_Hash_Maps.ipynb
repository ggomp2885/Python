    "of an array, and a linked list, and therefore have \n",

    "\n",
    "Some disadvantages\n",
    "Even though the time complexity is technically O(1) for many\n",
    "of these operations, for small arrays it is technically more\n",

    "Ohh I see, a hash table actually does have an array underneath ----\n",

    "and then assigns it to an array, \n",
    "where the index value is related to the result of the hash function,\n",

    "\n",
    "in other words, a hash table is an array with a custom index.\n",

    "\"we dont want to have an array that is 3 billion large,\n",
    "just because theres 3 billion potential hash codes\n",

    "Interesting, so the most common way to handle collisions, \n",
    "is called \"chaining\", and guess what, chaining just means, \n",
    "storing the values with the same hash keys into a linked list\n",
    "that is so cool how the best data structures are actually combinations of all\n",
    "thats why they had us learn a linked list first, because Id have to know a linked list\n",
    "before truly being able to understand a hash map\n",
    "\n",
    "it seems like arrays are the smallest building blocks of programming\n",
    "then linked lists are built with 1000's of \"tiny\" arrays,\n",
    "then hash tables are built with a combination of a hash function, an array, and linkedlists\n",
    "\n",
    "Ohh I see, the \"modular\" thing they talked about earlier,\n",
    "thats what shoves the hash key value down to fit in the array size I want.\n",
    "\"15 mod 8 = 7\" \"so that gives you a range of 7\"\n",
    "okay so basically everything fits into 7 indexes, and just becomes a longer linked list after that,\n",

    "the size of the array I want to use, just literally means,\n",
    "100/ 10 = 10 spots, its like the ratio or w/e of the hash function to the index #\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function for a hash table does not need to be cryptic,\n",
    "infact we want it to be as simple and fast as possible,\n",
    "hash functions that are based on security are supposed to be cryptic,\n",
