So it seems like alot of these top solutions are doing that, they are hand crafting the algorithm to take the least amount of steps possible, whereas I am still needing to focus on the the syntax to write the brute force way in the first place... I am officially in the top 6% of coders going through these challenges --- so to take that into account - do I feel the need to be in the top .1% of python code? lol, not really, so yeah, that helps me realize the importance between solving more challenges which puts me up to the 94%+ range of coders, - I guess this is what I needed to see though, I wasnt sure if there were drastically better ways of writing things, and I hadnt an idea what they would even look like\n",

Thats smart. - makes sense, if youre going to do something / remove something in a string, you can always just index slice it out, no need for a .replace function for empty spaces.\n",
