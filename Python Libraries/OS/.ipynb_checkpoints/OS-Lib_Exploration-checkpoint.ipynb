    "This library is used for accessing files within the storage system your working on. It comes with functions for listing the files in a directory, counting them, accessing them, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OS library is super useful when working with file paths in python, because python has issues with windows formatting. Backslashes are an \"escape\" character in python, so a simple replace command on a file path, will not work. Its not worth writing these \"path\" functions out by hand, because there is a large list of errors and exceptions inherent in these operations that are best left to the OS lib."
