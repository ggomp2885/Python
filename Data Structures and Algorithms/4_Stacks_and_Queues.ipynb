    "I want to create a dictionary which says,\n",

    "I cant do all these calculations,\n",

    "80: 1\n",

    "\n",
    "See now the optimal solution still has to touch every single number once\n",
    "but it just records the index change from this one time, and then adds this\n",
    "to the count for the following calls.\n",
    "basically the point of a dictionary, would be to hold this count value\n",
    "and instead of ans += stack[-1][1]\n",
    "it would be ans += dict[stack[-1]]\n",
    "essentially I would just end up with a dict and a stack,\n",

    "Really, all this solution says is,\n",
    "1. set the span to 1 day by default\n",
    "if the price is lower than the last_highest_price, then it literally just returns 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if the price is > last_highest_price:\n",
    "add 1 + 1, and return 2\n",

    "and then at some point, price > last_highest_price_recorded_2_days_ago\n",
    "add 1 + 2, and return 3\n",

    "Hence the other example that needed to keep track of the min and the max,\n",

    "especially with the whole, deque() that can pop left and pop right\n",
    "\n",
    "but I do think I can understand this:\n",
    "If I need to add each time a greater number is seen\n",
    "then Ill want a decreasing stack\n",
    "If I need to add each time a lower number is seen,\n",
    "then Ill want an increasing stack\n",

    "has been found, because I no longer have to keep [8,1,1,4,1,1,9]\n",
