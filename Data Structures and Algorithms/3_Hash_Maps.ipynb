    "Some disadvantages\n",
    "Even though the time complexity is technically O(1) for many\n",

    "just because theres 3 billion potential hash codes\n",

    "Interesting, so the most common way to handle collisions, \n",
    "is called \"chaining\", and guess what, chaining just means, \n",
    "storing the values with the same hash keys into a linked list\n",
    "that is so cool how the best data structures are actually combinations of all\n",
    "thats why they had us learn a linked list first, because Id have to know a linked list\n",
    "before truly being able to understand a hash map\n",
    "\n",
    "it seems like arrays are the smallest building blocks of programming\n",

    "Ohh I see, the \"modular\" thing they talked about earlier,\n",
    "thats what shoves the hash key value down to fit in the array size I want.\n",
